I started with the pdf, using Preview in mac I selected regions and
copied and created new doc, saved it as jpeg and then used
the online OCR program: http://asv.aso.ecei.tohoku.ac.jp/tesseract/
I then manually edited each file.

The files are named according to the page index in the pdf and the
section and page given in the page footer.  Page headers and footers
were not captured.

   we have a binary for the sh already I think.  this may be optional

e00-01 
    - I used spaces to line up the comment columns, not tabs.  I
      picked the column distance arbitrarily.
    - the bottom section looks like it could be tabbed but my tabstops
      didnt line up with the values given so I used spaces

e00-02
    - I used tabs for the start of each asm command but not for the
      separation between mnemonic and arguments since these didnt line up.
      with my tab stops.

e00-03
    - left "dis addresses" typo in per original

e00-05
    - cant tell if the "O" in quotes after 1: is a O or a 0.
    - left mispelled "mormally" in comment
    - left "file/etc/init" without space.

e00-06
    - left mis-spacing on 5: move r5,r1.

e00-10
    - left "/ect/init" typo
--------------------
e09-01
    - I'm using tabs between opcode and operands now
    - left "bic $!77,r1" although written comment says "? !177"
e09-02
    - left "movb    tty+38r0),r1" as is.  There's a write in 
      correction for "(" instead of "8".  This concerns me as it
      means there are probably some errors in this listing as
      the paren is most likely the right character here.
e09-03
    - hard to tell due to hand written correction, but I believe
      the line before "rts r0" reads "mov (sp)+,r0"
    - comment "ASC11" (one instead of I) left as is.
e09-04
    - text comment says a label was lost!  leaving it out for now.
    - correction "if count >=0" obscures original text in comment.
      no choice but to use new text.
    - "ASC11" sic
e09-05
    - 5th to last "byte" line 2nd column is uneadable.  pattern suggests
      the value "000"

   - I used tabs for the first tab stop and spaced out to the next step.
   - Per discussions with Brantley Coile it appears that the origianl
     source probably used tabs, and that the printout has a tab stop
     after 8 characters and another after 7 characters.  The spaces
     between opcode and operands are probably due to a tab, as can be
     seen in later assembly code we have in machine readable form.
